# Data vis project

### Introduction

Trying to understanding the concepts of a new machine learning model can often be a confusing journey. The aim of this project is to explore how data visualizations can be utilized as a didactic tool to help ease this journey. The purpose these visualizations are to describe how, multi domain lexicons are created, to an audience with some prior knowledge in natural language processing(ALP) and machine learning. These lexicons are used to find and map concepts from one domain to another domain, e.g ”written” in ”book” reviews would be ”composed” in ”DVD” reviews [3]. The data used in this project originates from amazon reviews and has already been prepossessed to a bag of word representation only containing lower cased letters. These reviews are from 4 different domains ”books”, ”DVD”, ”electronics” and ”kitchen”. The raw data and the prepossessed is available at https://GitHub.com/barneys pain/domain_blase[1].
